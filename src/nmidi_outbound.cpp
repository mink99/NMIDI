/** Bank Select in one message.

The Bank Select messages are actually MIDI Controller messages,
just like Volume, Pan, Sustain Pedal, Wind, and other controllers.
Specifically, the controller number for the "Most Significant Byte" (ie, MSB) of Bank Select is controller 0.
The controller number for "Least Significant Byte" (ie, LSB) of Bank Select is controller 32.
The data for these messages are the bank number you want to select.
(Sometimes the MSB Bank Select is referred to as the coarse adjustment for bank,
and the LSB Bank Select is referred to as the fine adjustment).

test onOff

A MIDI Controller message that controls the ability of a synthesizer to be played by means of its own keyboard.
The local control message has one parameter, which may be an "on" or "off" value.
When a synth with a keyboard receives a local control off message, the sound-producing part of the synth,
and the keyboard and ancillary performance controls (pitch wheel etc.) behave as two separate units.
Pressing a key will not produce a sound but will send messages out of the MIDI out port,
while the sound-producing part of the synth will produce sound only in response to messages coming in through the MIDI in port.
Receiving a local control on message restores normal operation.
